# Bolt Automations by Squash

**Save tokens. Save time. Ship faster with bolt.new**

Stop burning through tokens and missing important updates. This Chrome extension automatically manages your bolt.new workflow to dramatically reduce token usage and keep you informed of every task completion, error, or required input.

## üí∞ Save Tokens, üöÄ Save Time

### How it saves your tokens
- **Auto Discussion Mode**: Automatically switches bolt to discussion mode after each task completion
- **Why this matters**: Discussion Mode uses approximately 90% fewer tokens than Build Mode (according to [bolt.new official docs](https://support.bolt.new/best-practices/maximizing-token-efficiency))
- **Result**: Massive token savings - discussion mode helps bolt think and plan its next steps without going off the rails

### How it saves your time  
- **Never Miss a Beat**: Real-time Discord notifications when tasks complete, errors occur, or input is needed
- **Read Less, Decide Faster**: Optional AI-powered summaries give you the essential information without wading through verbose outputs
- **Stay in Flow**: No more tab-switching or constant checking - get notified and stay focused on what matters

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Smart Token Management**: Auto-enables discussion mode after task completion
- üîî **Instant Discord Notifications**: Know immediately when bolt needs your attention
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Summaries**: Get concise updates with your choice of AI provider (optional)
- üîí **Privacy First**: All credentials stored locally, never sent to external servers
- ‚ö° **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with just a Discord webhook

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kstonekuan/bolt-automations-browser-extension.git
   cd bolt-automations-browser-extension
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

2. Load in Chrome:

## How It Works

1. **You work normally** - Use bolt.new as you always do
2. **Extension monitors** - Detects when tasks complete, errors occur, or input is needed
3. **Smart actions trigger**:
   - Automatically switches to discussion mode (saves tokens)
   - Sends Discord notification (saves time)
   - Generates AI summary if configured (saves reading)
4. **You stay informed** - Get notified without tab-switching or manual checking

## Configuration

### Discord Webhook (Optional)
1. In Discord: Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí New Webhook
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Paste in extension settings

### AI Provider & API Key (Optional)
Adds AI-powered summaries to notifications. Choose from:

- **Anthropic (Claude 3 Haiku)**: Fast and cost-effective Claude model

Without an API key: You get bolt's raw message  
With an API key: You get concise, actionable summaries

## Troubleshooting

**No notifications?**
