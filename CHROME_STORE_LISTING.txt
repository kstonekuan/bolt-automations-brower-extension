Stop burning through tokens and missing important updates on bolt.new!

Bolt Automations dramatically reduces your token usage while keeping you informed of every task completion, error, or required input.

üí∞ Save 90% of Your Tokens
Our smart automation automatically switches bolt to discussion mode after each task completion. According to bolt.new official docs, Discussion Mode uses approximately 90% fewer tokens than Build Mode. This means massive savings on your AI costs while maintaining full productivity.

üöÄ Never Miss Important Updates
Get instant Discord notifications when:
‚Ä¢ Tasks complete successfully
‚Ä¢ Errors occur that need your attention  
‚Ä¢ Bolt needs your input to continue
‚Ä¢ Any significant event happens in your workflow

ü§ñ AI-Powered Summaries (Optional)
Choose from three AI providers to get concise, actionable summaries instead of verbose outputs:
‚Ä¢ Google Gemini - Free tier available!
‚Ä¢ Anthropic Claude - Fast and efficient
‚Ä¢ OpenAI - Powerful and reliable

‚ú® Key Features
